## üîÑ How It Works

1. The workflow reads the list of Amazon ASINs from your Google Sheet.
2. It calls the **ScrapeOps API** to get the current price of each product.
3. It compares the new price with the previous one.
4. If the change is above or below your defined thresholds, it sends an email alert.
5. Each result is saved in your **Google Sheet** for future tracking.
